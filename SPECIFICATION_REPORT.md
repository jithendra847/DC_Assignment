## 📌 About the Project

The **Digital Signal Encoder and Decoder** demonstrates how digital data is generated, encoded into electrical signal levels, transmitted using different line-coding schemes, and reconstructed through decoding.

The project also explores analog-to-digital conversion using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM) and Delta Modulation (DM). Encoded signals and reconstructed analog samples are visualized using waveform plots.

The application provides an interactive command-line interface and keeps the implementation modular while maintaining a simple folder structure.

### 🎯 Objectives

- Generate random binary data and test patterns containing consecutive zeros.
- Find the longest contiguous palindromic substring efficiently.
- Implement five digital line-coding schemes.
- Apply B8ZS and HDB3 scrambling to AMI signals.
- Implement PCM and Delta Modulation encoders and decoders.
- Visualize encoded signals and reconstructed staircases.
- Decode a line-coded signal by analysing its saved waveform image.
- Verify functionality through automated tests.

## ✅ Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure the following are installed:

1. **Python 3.10 or newer** — required to execute the application.
2. **Visual Studio Code** — recommended for editing and running the project.
3. **Git** — required to clone the repository and manage commits.
4. **Python dependencies** — installed through `requirements.txt`.

Check your installed versions:

```powershell
python --version
git --version
```

If Python is not recognized on Windows, install it and ensure it is available in your system's PATH.

---

## 🚀 Installation and Setup

### Step 1 — Clone the repository

Open the VS Code terminal and execute:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/jithendra847/DC_Assignment.git
cd DC_Assignment
```

### Step 2 — Create a virtual environment

A virtual environment isolates this project's dependencies from other Python projects.

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

Activate it in Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

If activation is blocked by your PowerShell execution policy, you can still run the environment's Python executable directly, or use the VS Code Command Palette to select `.venv` as your interpreter.

### Step 3 — Install dependencies

```powershell
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4 — Run the application

```powershell
python main.py
```

Follow the interactive prompts to select a data-input mode, encoding scheme, and optional decoding operation.

## 🔄 How the Application Works

The program supports two input paths.

```

### 🖼️ Image-Based Decoding

For line-code decoding, the program samples the saved waveform image to estimate voltage levels and then interprets those levels according to the selected scheme.

The decoder uses the image and required decoding metadata rather than receiving the original digital bitstream or encoder voltage array. B8ZS/HDB3 signals additionally require the appropriate descrambling logic.

## 📚 Algorithms and Signal Conventions

### Longest Palindromic Substring

The program uses **Manacher's algorithm** to find the longest contiguous palindrome.

- Time complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Auxiliary space complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Output: palindrome text, length, and zero-based starting index.
- If multiple maximum-length palindromes exist, the earliest occurrence is returned.

The longest consecutive-zero-run calculation is also performed in \(O(n)\) time.

### Line-Coding Conventions

| Scheme | Convention |
|---|---|
| NRZ-L | `0 → +1 V`, `1 → −1 V` |
| NRZ-I | `1` causes a transition at the beginning of a bit; `0` causes none. |
| Manchester | `0 → [+1, −1]`, `1 → [−1, +1]` |
| Differential Manchester | Every bit transitions in the middle; `0` also transitions at the beginning. |
| AMI | `0 → 0 V`; successive `1` pulses alternate between `+1 V` and `−1 V`. |
| B8ZS | Replaces eight consecutive zeros using the standard `000VB0VB` substitution. |
| HDB3 | Replaces four consecutive zeros using `000V` or `B00V`, depending on the applicable polarity and parity rules. |

Initial voltage and pulse-polarity conventions must be consistent between the corresponding encoder and decoder.

### Analog Modulation

**Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)** quantizes analog sample values and represents each quantized value as a fixed-width binary codeword. Decoding reconstructs an approximation using the quantization information.

**Delta Modulation (DM)** encodes whether the reconstructed level needs to increase or decrease. Its decoder rebuilds the signal using a configurable step size and initial reference level, producing a staircase approximation.

---

## 🧪 Testing and Verification

The project includes `test_project.py` for automated testing with Python's built-in `unittest` framework.

Run the tests from the repository root:

```powershell
python -m unittest test_project -v
```

The tests should cover the implemented functions, including:

- Random data generation and binary input validation.
- Four/eight-zero generation and longest-zero-run detection.
- Longest palindrome detection and edge cases.
- Line-coding voltage levels and transition rules.
- AMI, B8ZS, and HDB3 substitution and decoding.
- PCM quantization and Delta Modulation reconstruction.
- Waveform plotting, image sampling, and line-code recovery.

**Important:** run the tests after modifying the source code. Successful tests do not replace manual verification of the application's interactive paths and generated plots.

---

## ⚠️ Assumptions and Limitations

- Binary input must contain only `0` and `1`.
- PCM uses uniform quantization according to the implemented configuration, and input values outside the supported range may be clipped.
- Delta Modulation requires a valid positive step size.
- Encoders and decoders must use matching polarity conventions and initial reference levels.
- Image-based decoding depends on the waveform style and calibration used by the project's plotter. Constant-level or visually ambiguous waveforms may not contain enough information for reliable image-based decoding.
- Generated waveform PNG files may be excluded from Git by `.gitignore`; save or submit required plots separately if requested.
